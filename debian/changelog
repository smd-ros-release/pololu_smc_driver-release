ros-hydro-pololu-smc-driver (0.1.4-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Fixed driver nodelet
  * Make settings respect param server, lock in serial
    Settings behavior has changed to:
    1) initially query device for settings
    2) make settings match those explicitly set in param server
    3) update param server with newly merged settings
    After initial startup, parameter server should have all settings in it. This makes subsequent disconnect/reconnect cycles have the exact same settings that the device had before the disconnect/reconnect cycle, even if device settings changed or were lost.
    Also, once the driver is connected to a device, it will only connect to that exact device on a subsequent disconnect/reconnect cycle. If you need to swap devices, you need to restart the driver. If the parameter server is not restarted as well and the node name doesn't change, then the old settings will be sent to the new device.
  * Initial failure clarification
  * Fix dependency on gencfg

ros-hydro-pololu-smc-driver (0.1.0-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Fixed settings update
  * Fixed update frequency diagnostic
    Forgot to tick( ) it!
  * Re-worked library linking pipeline
    This should make things compile on Ubuntu as well. I don't understand this fully, but it seems that Ubuntu has trouble linking C libraries later, and Fedora doesn't...
  * Fixed catkin_package arguments
    This should only affect dependant packages
  * Added libsmc_driver.so to catkin LIBRARIES
    Should have only affected dependant packages
